I worked alone on this project, so every line of code is my own.

Everything functions as explained in the MP2 documentation.
Testing was done primarily on a single machine with 127.0.0.1
as the IP for every node and the manager so the program may not
behave perfectly across different IPs. 

The programs usage is as specified in the documentation.
